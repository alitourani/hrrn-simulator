Operating System - Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) Algorithm Simulation

Given n processes with their Arrival times and Burst times, the task is to find average waiting time and average turn around time using HRRN scheduling algorithm. A process once selected will run till completion.
The main formula for HRRN algorithm is Response Ratio = (W + S)/S where W is the waiting time of the process so far and S is the Burst time of the process.
